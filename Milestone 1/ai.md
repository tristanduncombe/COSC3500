# AI Usage in Project

In this project, I have utilized the generative AI tool called GitHub Copilot to assist me debugging my work. The extent of my usage and the process involved are as follows:

1. Initial Snippets:

    - I used GitHub Copilot to generate initial code snippets for portions of my code, such as the visualisation and octree.
    - These code snippets provided a starting point, which I then revised and customised and developed to fit my use case.

2. Debugging Assistance:
    - Occasionally, when encountering issues or bugs in my code and I may have used GitHub Copilot as a rubber duck to determine issues in my code.
    - I reviewed and modified the suggested code to fit the specific context of my project.
    - It was used as a tool to assist in the debugging process, but the final code was always reviewed and revised by me.

By acknowledging the use of GitHub Copilot and providing a clear description of how it was used, I ensure that all the code in this project is my own work. Any code generated by Copilot was treated as a starting point and subsequently modified.

Please note that all the code in this project has been reviewed and revised by me.
